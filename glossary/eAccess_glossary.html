                        having this List. The Evidence Type List describes thus an AND condition on the different
                        Evidence Types within the list and an OR condition between two or more Evidence Type
                        Lists. Combinations of alternative Lists can be provided for a respondent of a Requirement

                        is left to implementers. In the case where the purpose is to link the two Requirements
                        without additional information, the simple relationship as proposed here can be directly
                        used.</td>
