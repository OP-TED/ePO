                        Brand name allows economic operators to distinctively describe an item in their eCatalogue.

                        An Item can be an atomic Thing or a composition of things that together are seen as

                        The Item is provided with its components, however, the component Items may also be
                        provided separately. 
                        For example, a bicycle has wheels as components, but they may be provided as spare
                        parts as well. 
                        This relation is useful to describe different package levels of an item or hierarchies
                        of Items.
