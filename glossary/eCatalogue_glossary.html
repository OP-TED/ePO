                        An Item can be an atomic Thing or a composition of things that together are seen as
                        a unit, e.g. a tetrabrik of milk or an indivisible package of six tetrabriks.

                        The Item is provided with its components, however, the component Items may also be
                        provided separately. 
                        For example, a bicycle has wheels as components, but they may be provided as spare
                        parts as well. 
                        This relation is useful to describe different package levels of an item or hierarchies
                        of Items.
