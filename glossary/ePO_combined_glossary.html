                        pre-selected, and the mini competition is used to determine which supplier is best
                        suited for a particular project or contract.
                        It is also used in a Dynamic Purchasing System where the suppliers come from a list

                        As per the European Procurement Directives the notion of ‘Economic Operators’ should

                        on the market, irrespective of the legal form under which they have chosen to operate.

                        At the present time Procurement Procedures are not fully electronic. At a later date,
                        information on the Tenders received could be inferred by the data in the eProcurement
                        System.
                        Therefore this class is temporal and should cease to exist in fully electronic Procurement.
                        The need for its presence responds also to the alignment with the Regulation (EU)
                        2019/1780 (eForms).
                        
                        Attention will have to be paid in the future to possible inconsistencies derived from
                        data placed in other classes and data held in the Statistical Information class; e.g.
                        the TenderEvaluation class (see eEvaluation diagram) has the attribute admissibileTender
                        indicator, which in case of being false, may enter in contradiction with the highest
                        or lowest Tender value for that very same inadmissible Tender.
