                        Additional Information:
                        Constraints are Requirements in themselves, since they impose prerequisites which
                        influence the definition, use and/or Fulfilment of the Requirement. They represent
                        hard conditions such as minimum or maximum expressions which can be used to evaluate
                        pieces of information, the required age, income, involvement in activities, etc. An
                        example from the eProcurement domain is a threshold as the minimum turnover required
                        by the buying Organisation to select the Candidates. Note that CCCEV does not provide
                        any specific guidance on when which kind of Requirement should be used. Users of this
                        vocabulary should make decisions on this topic in their specific context.</td>

                        Additional Information:
                        In general, Criteria are used for comparison, filtering or Selection purposes. Criteria
                        usually set minimum conditions (e.g. limits, intervals, thresholds, etc.) that need
                        to be met in order to pass the Requirements or to fulfil them to a certain degree
                        or quality. The concept of Criteria is broader than the concept of Constraint since
                        it covers more usages. The evaluation of the fulfilment is usually supported by the
                        provision of Evidence. For example in the eProcurement domain, the eProcurement Ontology
                        defines different subclasses of Criterion such as Exclusion Grounds, Selection Criteria
                        or Award Criteria. A concrete example of a Criterion is 'participation in a criminal
                        organisation' which could also be considered as an Exclusion Ground Criterion in the
                        procurement domain or for requiring a public service.</td>

                        Additional Information:
                        Requirement is a generic class representing any type of prerequisite that may be desired,
                        needed or imposed as an obligation. CCCEV recommends to not use the Requirement class
                        directly, but rather a more semantically-enriched subclass such as Criterion, Information
                        Requirement or Constraint. Also note that the Requirement class is specified at a
                        more abstract level and is not to be used as the instantiation of a Requirement for
                        a specific Agent.
                        To illustrate the notion: the European Directive on services in the internal market
                        defines requirement as any obligation, prohibition, condition or limit provided for
                        in the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the Member States or in consequence
                        of case-law, administrative practice, the rules of professional bodies, or the collective
                        rules of professional associations or other professional Organisations, adopted in
                        the exercise of their legal autonomy.
                        To stay consistent to how identification is realised in the eProcurement ontology,
                        we switch to using `adms:identifier` instead of `dct:identifier` as per CCCEV specification.</td>

                        Anything that can specify the procurement content (i.e. goods, services, work) is
                        a Procurement Object. 
                        In a sense, such an "object" can constitute the "object of a Contract".
                        To test whether something is a Procedure Object check if it can have a Purpose and/or
                        CPV classification (&lt;i&gt;The CPV establishes a single classification system for public

                        At the present time Procurement Procedures are not fully electronic. At a later date,
                        information on the Tenders received could be inferred by the data in the eProcurement
                        System.
                        Therefore this class is temporal and should cease to exist in fully electronic Procurement.
                        The need for its presence responds also to the alignment with the Regulation (EU)
                        2019/1780 (eForms).
                        
                        Attention will have to be paid in the future to possible inconsistencies derived from
                        data placed in other classes and data held in the Statistical Information class; e.g.
                        the TenderEvaluation class (see eEvaluation diagram) has the attribute admissibileTender
                        indicator, which in case of being false, may enter in contradiction with the highest
                        or lowest Tender value for that very same inadmissible Tender.

                        An "Address Representation" as conceptually defined by the INSPIRE Address Representation
                        data type: "Representation of an address spatial object for use in external application
                        schemas that need to include the basic, address information in a readable way.".
                        
                        
                        The representation of Addresses varies widely from one country's postal System to
                        another. Even within countries, there are almost always examples of Addresses that
                        do not conform to the stated national standard. At the time of publication, work is
                        progressing on ISO 19160-1 that defines a method through which different Addresses
                        can be converted from one conceptual model to another.
                        
                        
                        This specification was heavily based on the INSPIRE Address Representation data type.
                        It is noteworthy that if an Address is provided using the detailed breakdown suggested
                        by the properties for this class, then it will be INSPIRE-conformant. To this very
                        granular set of properties, we add two further properties:
                        
                        - full address (the complete address as a formatted string)
                        - addressID (a unique identifier for the address)
                        The first of these allows publishers to simply provide the complete Address as one
                        string, with or without formatting. This is analogous to vCard's label property.
                        
                        The addressID is part of the INSPIRE guidelines and provides a hook that can be used
                        to link the Address to an alternative representation, such as vCard or OASIS xAL.</td>

                        etc. expressed using coordinates in some coordinate reference System.
                        
                        Additional Information:
                        This class defines the notion of "Geometry" at the conceptual level, and it shall
                        be encoded by using different formats (see usage note of the locn:geometry property).
                        We also refer to the Examples section of this specification for a number of different
                        Geometry examples expressed in different formats.</td>

                        The bias parameter tries to correct a systematic error. For example in procurement,
                        a home bias corresponds to the "presence of local preferences distorting international
                        specialisation and resource allocation". When quantified, this systematic error can
                        be removed.</td>

                        a weighted sum equal to 1.</td>

                        The xsd:dateTime here means that we can provide either xsd:date, xsd:dateTime, or
                        xsd:timeStamp or any other variant of time expression. This extension needs to be
                        encoded/automated in the ontology and in the application profile. 
                        Why is it like this? Because UML cannot handle such expressions of disjunctive property
                        ranges.

                        For example, a contract may be valid for one year and the buyer may keep a possibility
                        to renew it (e.g. once, twice) for another three months, if he is content with the
                        services he received.

                        Best practice is to use the ISO 3166-1 code but if this is inappropriate for the context,
                        country names should be provided in a consistent manner to reduce ambiguity. For example,
                        either write 'France' or 'FRA' consistently throughout the dataset and avoid mixing
                        the two. The Country controlled vocabulary from the Publications Office can be reused
                        for this.</td>

                        might arise through the breaking up of an address into its component parts. This property
                        is analogous to vCard's label property but with two important differences: (1) formatting
                        is not assumed so that, unlike vCard label, it may not be suitable to print this on
                        an address label, (2) vCard's label property has a domain of vCard Address; the fullAddress
                        property has no such restriction. An example of a full address is "Champ de Mars,
                        5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France".</td>

                        Additional Information:
                        The INSPIRE Data Specification on Geographical Names provides a detailed model for
                        describing a 'named place', including methods for providing multiple names in multiple
                        scripts. This is beyond what is necessary for the Core Location Vocabulary but, importantly,
                        the concept of a geographic name used here is consistent.
                        
                        A geographic name is a proper noun applied to a spatial object. Taking the example
                        used in the INSPIRE document (page 15), the following are all valid geographic names
                        for the Greek capital:
                        
                        - "Aθnνa"@gr-Grek (the Greek endonym written in the Greek script)
                        - "Ath&amp;#237;na"@gr-Latn (the standard Romanisation of the endonym)
                        - "Athens"@en (the English language exonym)
                        INSPIRE has a detailed (XML-based) method of providing metadata about a geographic
                        name and in XML-data sets that may be the most appropriate method to follow. When
                        using the Core Location Vocabulary in data sets that are not focussed on environmental/geographical
                        data (the use case for INSPIRE), the Code datatype or a simple language identifier
                        may be used to provide such metadata.
                        
                        The country codes defined in ISO 3166 may be used as geographic names and these are
                        generally preferred over either the long form or short form of a country's name (as
                        they are less error prone). The Publications Office of the European Union recommends
                        the use of ISO 3166-1 codes for countries in all cases except two:
                        
                        - use 'UK' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GB for the United Kingdom;
                        - use 'EL' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GR for Greece.
                        Where a country has changed its name or no longer exists (such as Czechoslovakia,
                        Yugoslavia etc.) use the ISO 3166-3 code.</td>

                        such as "Flat 3, 17 Bridge Street", the locator is "flat 3, 17".</td>

                        Additional Information:
                        The locator name could be the name of the property or complex, of the building or
                        part of the building, or it could be the name of a room inside a building.
                        
                        The key difference between a locator and a locator name is that the latter is a proper
                        name and is unlikely to include digits. For example, "Shumann, Berlaymont" is a meeting
                        room within the European Commission headquarters for which locator name is more appropriate
                        than locator.</td>

                        Additional Information:
                        The concept of adding a globally unique identifier for each instance of an address
                        is a crucial part of the INSPIRE data spec. A number of EU countries have already
                        implemented an ID (a UUID) in their Address Register/gazetteer, among them Denmark.
                        OASIS xAL also includes an address identifier. It is the address Identifier that allows
                        an address to be represented in a format other than INSPIRE whilst remaining conformant
                        to the Core Vocabulary.
                        
                        The INSPIRE method of representing addresses is very detailed, designed primarily
                        for use in databases of addresses. Whilst data that is published in full conformance
                        with the INSPIRE data structure can be made available using the Location Core Vocabulary
                        the reverse is not true since the Core Vocabulary allows much greater flexibility.
                        
                        Many datasets that include address data as one piece of information about something
                        else are likely to have that data in simpler formats. These might be tailored to the
                        specific need of the dataset, follow a national norm, or make use of a standard like
                        vCard.
                        
                        To provide maximum flexibility in the Core Vocabulary, whilst remaining interoperable
                        with INSPIRE Address Guidelines (which EU Member States are obliged to use), the Location
                        Core Vocabulary provides the extra property of full address and makes use of INSPIRE's
                        addressID.</td>

                        Additional Information:
                        GeoNames.org provides stable, widely recognised identifiers for more than 10 million
                        geographical names that can be used as links to further information. For example,
                        http://sws.geonames.org/593116/ identifies the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. Unfortunately
                        these URIs cannot easily be automatically deduced since the URI scheme uses simple
                        numeric codes. Finding a GeoNames identifier for a Location is almost always a manual
                        process. Where such identifiers are known or can be found, however, it is recommended
                        that they be used.
                        
                        Where the Location Class is used to identify a country, if the geonames URI is not
                        known, the recommendation is to use DBpedia URIs of the form http://dbpedia.org/resource/ISO_3166-1:XX
                        where XX is the ISO 3166 two character code for the country.
                        
                        The EU's Publication Office diverges from ISO 3166-1 and uses EL and UK for Greece
                        and the United Kingdom respectively. DBpedia sticks to the ISO codes and so the correct
                        URIs for these countries are:
                        
                        - http://dbpedia.org/resource/ISO_3166-1:GR
                        - http://dbpedia.org/resource/ISO_3166-1:GB
                        even when the geographic name is given as EL or UK.
                        
                        The use of a URIs has added advantages:
                        
                        - it can be used by automated systems to look up additional data (linked data);
                        - a triple store may store only one copy of the URI, whereas if a string is used,
                        a copy of that string is always stored for each and every person in the database.
                        Thus, in large data sets, the saving on memory capacity and the improvement in transmission
                        efficiency can be substantial.
