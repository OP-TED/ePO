rov:RegisteredOrganization dcterms:identifier "rov:RegisteredOrganization";
	a rdfs:Class,
		owl:Class;
	rdfs:comment """rov:RegisteredOrganization is the key class for the Registered Organization vocabulary and represents 
    an organization that is legally registered. In many countries there is a single registry although in others, such 
    as Spain and Germany, multiple registries exist. A Registered Organization is able to trade, is legally liable for 
    its actions, accounts, tax affairs etc. Legal entity status is conferred by the act of registration cf. 
    org:FormalOrganization that applies to any legal entity, including those created by other legal means.
    This makes registered organizations distinct from the broader concept of organizations, groups or, in 
    some jurisdictions, sole traders. Many organizations exist that are not legal entities yet to the outside world 
    they have staff, hierarchies, locations etc. Other organizations exist that are an umbrella for several legal entities 
    (universities are often good examples of this). This vocabulary is concerned solely with registered organizations.
    In RDF, Registered Organization is a sub class of the Organization Ontology's org:FormalOrganization which is itself a 
    sub class of the more general 'Agent' class found in FOAF and Dublin Core that does encompass organizations, 
    natural persons, groups etc. - i.e. an Agent is any entity that is able to carry out actions.</p>"""@en;
