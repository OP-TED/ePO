For example, http://sws.geonames.org/593116/ identifies the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. Unfortunately these URIs cannot easily be automatically deduced since the URI scheme uses simple numeric codes. Finding a GeoNames identifier for a Location is almost always a manual process. Where such identifiers are known or can be found, however, it is recommended that they be used.

Where the Location Class is used to identify a country, if the geonames URI is not known, the recommendation is to use DBpedia URIs of the form http://dbpedia.org/resource/ISO_3166-1:XX where XX is the ISO 3166 two character code for the country.

The EU's Publication Office diverges from ISO 3166-1 and uses EL and UK for Greece and the United Kingdom respectively. DBpedia sticks to the ISO codes and so the correct URIs for these countries are:

- http://dbpedia.org/resource/ISO_3166-1:GB

An "address representation" as conceptually defined by the INSPIRE Address Representation data type: "Representation of an address spatial object for use in external application schemas that need to include the basic, address information in a readable way.".


The representation of Addresses varies widely from one country's postal system to another. Even within countries, there are almost always examples of Addresses that do not conform to the stated national standard. At the time of publication, work is progressing on ISO 19160-1 that defines a method through which different Addresses can be converted from one conceptual model to another.


This specification was heavily based on the INSPIRE Address Representation data type. It is noteworthy that if an Address is provided using the detailed breakdown suggested by the properties for this class, then it will be INSPIRE-conformant. To this very granular set of properties, we add two further properties:

- full address (the complete address as a formatted string)
- addressID (a unique identifier for the address)
The first of these allows publishers to simply provide the complete Address as one string, with or without formatting. This is analogous to vCard's label property.

The addressID is part of the INSPIRE guidelines and provides a hook that can be used to link the Address to an alternative representation, such as vCard or OASIS xAL."""@en ;

Additional Information:
The INSPIRE Data Specification on Geographical Names provides a detailed model for describing a 'named place', including methods for providing multiple names in multiple scripts. This is beyond what is necessary for the Core Location Vocabulary but, importantly, the concept of a geographic name used here is consistent.

A geographic name is a proper noun applied to a spatial object. Taking the example used in the INSPIRE document (page 15), the following are all valid geographic names for the Greek capital:

- "Aθnνa"@gr-Grek (the Greek endonym written in the Greek script)
- "Ath&#237;na"@gr-Latn (the standard Romanisation of the endonym)
- "Athens"@en (the English language exonym)
INSPIRE has a detailed (XML-based) method of providing metadata about a geographic name and in XML-data sets that may be the most appropriate method to follow. When using the Core Location Vocabulary in data sets that are not focussed on environmental/geographical data (the use case for INSPIRE), the Code datatype or a simple language identifier may be used to provide such metadata.

The country codes defined in ISO 3166 may be used as geographic names and these are generally preferred over either the long form or short form of a country's name (as they are less error prone). The Publications Office of the European Union recommends the use of ISO 3166-1 codes for countries in all cases except two:

- use 'UK' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GB for the United Kingdom;
- use 'EL' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GR for Greece.

Additional Information:
In general, Criteria are used for comparison, filtering or selection purposes. Criteria usually set minimum conditions (e.g. limits, intervals, thresholds, etc.) that need to be met in order to pass the requirements or to fulfil them to a certain degree or quality. The concept of Criteria is broader than the concept of Constraint since it covers more usages. The evaluation of the fulfilment is usually supported by the provision of Evidence. For example in the eProcurement domain, the eProcurement Ontology defines different subclasses of Criterion such as exclusion grounds, selection criteria or award criteria.

        This module provides the definitions for the eProcurement ontology core.
        Procurement data has been identified as data with a high-reuse potential.
        Given the increasing importance of data standards for eProcurement, a number of initiatives
        driven by the public sector, the industry and academia have been kick-started in recent years.
        Some have grown organically, while others are the result of standardisation work.
        The vocabularies and the semantics that they are introducing, the phases of public procurement that they are covering,
        and the technologies that they are using all differ. These differences hamper data interoperability and thus its reuse by them or by the wider public.
        This creates the need for a common data standard for publishing procurement data, hence allowing data
        from different sources to be easily accessed and linked, and consequently reused.
