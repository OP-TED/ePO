Description: The eFulfilment module contains classes specific to the handling, storage, packing, and 
shipping of orders.

Files:
The conventions_report file contains the UML Conventions Comformance Report of eFulfilment (as an HTML
page). An automatically generated report that states the UML conformance violations of the UML model 
in file eFulfilment.xml.

The model2owl-config file contains the configuration files necessary for the model2owl toolchain
(https://github.com/OP-TED/model2owl) to transform the eFulfilment.xml file to a formal OWL ontology
including SHACL shapes.

The owl_ontology file contains the eFulfilment ontology files, as well as the restriction files. The files
are available in both RDF (https://www.w3.org/RDF/) and Turtle (https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) formats. 

The shacl_shapes file contains the SHACL (https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) shapes of eFulfilment in RDF and
Turtle format. SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is a W3C standard used for validating the contents
of an RDF graph.   

The xmi_conceptual_model file contains the eFulfilment.xml file. A representation of the UML model of 
the Ontology.
