**Description**:

The eContract module contains classes related to the concept of a Contract. 


**Files**:
- The *conventions_report* folder contains the [UML Conventions](https://meaningfy-ws.github.io/model2owl-docs/public-review/uml/conceptual-model-conventions.html) comformance report of the eContract module (as an HTML page). An automatically generated report that lists the ontology concepts in the eContract.xml file that violate the ePO UML conventions.


- The *model2owl-config* folder contains the configuration files necessary for the [model2owl toolchain](https://github.com/OP-TED/model2owl) to transform the eContract.xml file to a formal OWL ontology including SHACL shapes.


- The *owl_ontology* folder contains the eContract ontology files, as well as the restriction files. The files are available in [XML/RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/) and [Turtle/RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) formats. 


- The *shacl_shapes* folder contains the [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) shapes of eContract in RDF and Turtle format. SHACL ( Shapes Constraint Language) is a W3C standard used for validating the contents of an RDF graph. 


- The *[xmi](https://www.omg.org/spec/XMI/)_conceptual_model* folder contains the eContract.xml file. A representation of the UML model of the Ontology.
