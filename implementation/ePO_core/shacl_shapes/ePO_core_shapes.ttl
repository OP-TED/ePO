Constraints are Requirements in themselves, since they impose prerequisites which influence the definition, use and/or Fulfilment of the Requirement.

Additional Information:
In general, Criteria are used for comparison, filtering or Selection purposes. Criteria usually set minimum conditions (e.g. limits, intervals, thresholds, etc.) that need to be met in order to pass the Requirements or to fulfil them to a certain degree or quality. The concept of Criteria is broader than the concept of Constraint since it covers more usages. The evaluation of the fulfilment is usually supported by the provision of Evidence. For example in the eProcurement domain, the eProcurement Ontology defines different subclasses of Criterion such as Exclusion Grounds, Selection Criteria or Award Criteria. A concrete example of a Criterion is 'participation in a criminal organisation' which could also be considered as an Exclusion Ground Criterion in the procurement domain or for requiring a public service.""" ;

Additional Information:
Requirement is a generic class representing any type of prerequisite that may be desired, needed or imposed as an obligation. CCCEV recommends to not use the Requirement class directly, but rather a more semantically-enriched subclass such as Criterion, Information Requirement or Constraint. Also note that the Requirement class is specified at a more abstract level and is not to be used as the instantiation of a Requirement for a specific Agent.
To illustrate the notion: the European Directive on services in the internal market defines requirement as any obligation, prohibition, condition or limit provided for in the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the Member States or in consequence of case-law, administrative practice, the rules of professional bodies, or the collective rules of professional associations or other professional Organisations, adopted in the exercise of their legal autonomy.

Additional Information:
An "Address Representation" as conceptually defined by the INSPIRE Address Representation data type: "Representation of an address spatial object for use in external application schemas that need to include the basic, address information in a readable way.".


The representation of Addresses varies widely from one country's postal System to another. Even within countries, there are almost always examples of Addresses that do not conform to the stated national standard. At the time of publication, work is progressing on ISO 19160-1 that defines a method through which different Addresses can be converted from one conceptual model to another.


This specification was heavily based on the INSPIRE Address Representation data type. It is noteworthy that if an Address is provided using the detailed breakdown suggested by the properties for this class, then it will be INSPIRE-conformant. To this very granular set of properties, we add two further properties:

- full address (the complete address as a formatted string)
- addressID (a unique identifier for the address)
The first of these allows publishers to simply provide the complete Address as one string, with or without formatting. This is analogous to vCard's label property.

The addressID is part of the INSPIRE guidelines and provides a hook that can be used to link the Address to an alternative representation, such as vCard or OASIS xAL.""" ;
