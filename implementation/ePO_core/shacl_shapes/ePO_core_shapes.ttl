Additional Information: Constraints are Requirements in themselves, since they impose prerequisites which influence the definition, use and/or Fulfilment of the Requirement. They represent hard conditions such as minimum or maximum expressions which can be used to evaluate pieces of information, the required age, income, involvement in activities, etc. An example from the eProcurement domain is a threshold as the minimum turnover required by the buying Organisation to select the Candidates. Note that CCCEV does not provide any specific guidance on when which kind of Requirement should be used. Users of this vocabulary should make decisions on this topic in their specific context." ;

Criteria usually set minimum conditions (e.g. limits, intervals, thresholds, etc.) that need to be met in order to pass the Requirements or to fulfil them to a certain degree or quality. The concept of Criteria is broader than the concept of Constraint since it covers more usages. The evaluation of the fulfilment is usually supported by the provision of Evidence. For example in the eProcurement domain, the eProcurement Ontology defines different subclasses of Criterion such as Exclusion Grounds, Selection Criteria or Award Criteria. A concrete example of a Criterion is 'participation in a criminal organisation' which could also be considered as an Exclusion Ground Criterion in the procurement domain or for requiring a public service." ;

Additional Information: Requirement is a generic class representing any type of prerequisite that may be desired, needed or imposed as an obligation. CCCEV recommends to not use the Requirement class directly, but rather a more semantically-enriched subclass such as Criterion, Information Requirement or Constraint. Also note that the Requirement class is specified at a more abstract level and is not to be used as the instantiation of a Requirement for a specific Agent. To illustrate the notion: the European Directive on services in the internal market defines requirement as any obligation, prohibition, condition or limit provided for in the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the Member States or in consequence of case-law, administrative practice, the rules of professional bodies, or the collective rules of professional associations or other professional Organisations, adopted in the exercise of their legal autonomy.

The representation of Addresses varies widely from one country's postal System to another. Even within countries, there are almost always examples of Addresses that do not conform to the stated national standard. At the time of publication, work is progressing on ISO 19160-1 that defines a method through which different Addresses can be converted from one conceptual model to another. This specification was heavily based on the INSPIRE Address Representation data type. It is noteworthy that if an Address is provided using the detailed breakdown suggested by the properties for this class, then it will be INSPIRE-conformant. To this very granular set of properties, we add two further properties: - full address (the complete address as a formatted string) - addressID (a unique identifier for the address) The first of these allows publishers to simply provide the complete Address as one string, with or without formatting. This is analogous to vCard's label property. The addressID is part of the INSPIRE guidelines and provides a hook that can be used to link the Address to an alternative representation, such as vCard or OASIS xAL." ;

Finding a GeoNames identifier for a Location is almost always a manual process. Where such identifiers are known or can be found, however, it is recommended that they be used. Where the Location Class is used to identify a country, if the geonames URI is not known, the recommendation is to use DBpedia URIs of the form http://dbpedia.org/resource/ISO_3166-1:XX where XX is the ISO 3166 two character code for the country. The EU's Publication Office diverges from ISO 3166-1 and uses EL and UK for Greece and the United Kingdom respectively. DBpedia sticks to the ISO codes and so the correct URIs for these countries are: - http://dbpedia.org/resource/ISO_3166-1:GR - http://dbpedia.org/resource/ISO_3166-1:GB even when the geographic name is given as EL or UK. The use of a URIs has added advantages: - it can be used by automated systems to look up additional data (linked data); - a triple store may store only one copy of the URI, whereas if a string is used, a copy of that string is always stored for each and every person in the database.

Additional Information: The INSPIRE Data Specification on Geographical Names provides a detailed model for describing a 'named place', including methods for providing multiple names in multiple scripts. This is beyond what is necessary for the Core Location Vocabulary but, importantly, the concept of a geographic name used here is consistent. A geographic name is a proper noun applied to a spatial object. Taking the example used in the INSPIRE document (page 15), the following are all valid geographic names for the Greek capital: - \"Aθnνa\"@gr-Grek (the Greek endonym written in the Greek script) - \"Ath&#237;na\"@gr-Latn (the standard Romanisation of the endonym) - \"Athens\"@en (the English language exonym) INSPIRE has a detailed (XML-based) method of providing metadata about a geographic name and in XML-data sets that may be the most appropriate method to follow. When using the Core Location Vocabulary in data sets that are not focussed on environmental/geographical data (the use case for INSPIRE), the Code datatype or a simple language identifier may be used to provide such metadata. The country codes defined in ISO 3166 may be used as geographic names and these are generally preferred over either the long form or short form of a country's name (as they are less error prone). The Publications Office of the European Union recommends the use of ISO 3166-1 codes for countries in all cases except two: - use 'UK' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GB for the United Kingdom; - use 'EL' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GR for Greece. Where a country has changed its name or no longer exists (such as Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia etc.) use the ISO 3166-3 code." ;

Additional Information: The concept of adding a globally unique identifier for each instance of an address is a crucial part of the INSPIRE data spec. A number of EU countries have already implemented an ID (a UUID) in their Address Register/gazetteer, among them Denmark. OASIS xAL also includes an address identifier. It is the address Identifier that allows an address to be represented in a format other than INSPIRE whilst remaining conformant to the Core Vocabulary. The INSPIRE method of representing addresses is very detailed, designed primarily for use in databases of addresses. Whilst data that is published in full conformance with the INSPIRE data structure can be made available using the Location Core Vocabulary the reverse is not true since the Core Vocabulary allows much greater flexibility. Many datasets that include address data as one piece of information about something else are likely to have that data in simpler formats. These might be tailored to the specific need of the dataset, follow a national norm, or make use of a standard like vCard. To provide maximum flexibility in the Core Vocabulary, whilst remaining interoperable with INSPIRE Address Guidelines (which EU Member States are obliged to use), the Location Core Vocabulary provides the extra property of full address and makes use of INSPIRE's addressID." ;
