An automatically generated report that lists the ontology concepts in the ePO_core.xml file that violate the ePO UML conventions.


- The *model2owl-config* folder contains the configuration files necessary for the [model2owl toolchain](https://github.com/OP-TED/model2owl) to transform the ePO_core.xml file to a formal OWL ontology including SHACL shapes.


- The *owl_ontology* folder contains the ePO_core ontology files, as well as the restriction files. The files are available in [XML/RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) and [Turtle/RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) formats.
